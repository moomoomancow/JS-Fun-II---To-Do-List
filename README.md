This application allows users to create a To Do list.

Opening the index.html file will bring users to the To Do list page.

Typing a task into the input into the function will allow users to add items to the To Do list. Clicking on items within the list will cross-out items. Middle-clicking "scroll wheel" will move items between the To Do list and the Completed Tasks list.
